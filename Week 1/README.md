# Week 1

## What I have learn this week?
In Analysis and Algebra, I have been studying about groups and how they behave respect to many structures we know. For example, groups theorems, groups functions and relations. Also, I have learnt about permutations and cyclic permutations in my classes which have added a lot of value for my understanding.

## Tips for the topics
1. Always do more exercises and don't be scared of messing up.
2. Try to do many examples of algebraic structures
3. Look at the notation because sometimes it can be tricky, so when you don't understand something it is a good place to start

## Goals for Week 2
- Finish groups topic
- Learn about rings and fields
- Learn about complex numbers
- Learn about vector spaces and norms
